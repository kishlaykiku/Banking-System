# Banking System - Database and Java Application

## Overview

The Banking System is a project designed to simulate the operations of a real-world banking system. It includes functionalities such as managing customers, accounts, and transactions, along with implementing key banking features like deposits, withdrawals, and balance tracking. The project is part of an assignment that focuses on building a comprehensive database schema and a Java-based application following object-oriented programming principles.

The tasks in this project cover various aspects such as SQL schema design, database queries, and implementing Java classes for banking operations. The project will be developed in stages, with each task building upon the previous one.
